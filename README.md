# ctrl-semicolon
A simple extension to insert and remove semicolons at the end of lines.

## Features
We've all been there. You just finished expanding a snippet, and you realise you need a semicolon at the end of the line. I found myself naturally wanting to press ctrl+; just like I press ctrl+/ to comment. So I made this extension to fulfill that reality.

### Shortcuts added
Ctrl+;       (Cmd+;)         Add semicolon at the end of the line (if there isn't one already)
Ctrl+Shift+; (Cmd+Shift+;)   Remove the semicolon that is at the end of the line (if one exists)

## Known issues
The shortcuts have no effect with selections over multiple lines.

## Planned features
Making the shortcuts work with selections over multiple lines.
